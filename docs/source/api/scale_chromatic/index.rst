Scale Chromatic
===============

This module provides sequential, diverging and categorical color schemes designed to work with :code:`d3.scale_ordinal` and `d3.scale_sequential`. Most of these schemes are derived from Cynthia A. Brewer's ColorBrewer. Since ColorBrewer publishes only discrete color schemes, the sequential and diverging scales are interpolated using uniform B-splines.
